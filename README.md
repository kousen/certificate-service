# Certificate Service

A Spring Boot application that generates personalized certificates of ownership for books, complete with digital signatures and QR code verification.

## Overview

This service generates professionally designed certificates of ownership for book purchases. Each certificate:

- Is personalized with the purchaser's name
- Includes the book title
- Features an elegant background design
- Is digitally signed with a 4096-bit RSA key
- Includes a QR code for online verification

## Features

- **PDF Generation**: Creates beautiful certificates using HTML templates rendered to PDF
- **Digital Signatures**: Each PDF is cryptographically signed for authenticity
- **Certificate Verification**: QR codes link to a verification page with signature details
- **Certificate Storage**: Maintains copies of all generated certificates
- **RESTful API**: Simple API for certificate generation and retrieval

## Technologies

- Java 21 (with virtual threads)
- Spring Boot 3.4
- PDFBox 3.0 for PDF manipulation and signing
- BouncyCastle for cryptography
- ZXing for QR code generation

## API Endpoints

}
```

Response: PDF certificate file

### Available Book Titles

```
GET /api/certificates/books
```

Returns the list of available book titles that can be used in certificate generation.

### List Stored Certificates

```
GET /api/certificates/stored
```

Returns a list of all stored certificates.

### Retrieve a Stored Certificate

```

Returns a specific stored certificate by filename.

### Certificate Verification

```
GET /verify-certificate

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Gradle 8.5 or higher

### Steps

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/certificate-service.git
   cd certificate-service
   ```

2. Build the application
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. Run the application
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

4. Generate a certificate (example using curl)
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/certificates \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"purchaserName":"Ada Lovelace","bookTitle":"Modern Java Recipes"}' \
        -o ada.pdf
   ```

5. Open the generated PDF
   ```bash
   open ada.pdf
   ```

## Notes on Digital Signatures

The certificates are signed with a self-signed certificate, which means that Adobe Reader and other PDF readers may display warnings about the signature's validity. This is normal and doesn't affect the integrity of the signature itself. The verification page accessible via the QR code explains how to interpret these warnings.
